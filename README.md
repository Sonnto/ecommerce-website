# Anthony's Online Garage Sale (E-Commerce Website)

## Details

An MVP e-commerce website inspired by the designs of Amazon. The user can see a list of items for sale that is drawn from the Fake Store API. The user can create an order by selecting those items into a shopping cart, view their cart, remove or add more, and purchase their item via the Stripe API. If not signed in, the user will be prompted to before being able to view their orders and payig for their orders. Next.js was used to do server-side rendering so there would be less lag presenting full pages to the user; Tailwind CSS helped make the website responsive blazing fast; NextAuth was a great choice to add sign-in providers with ease; webhook integration and Stripe payment processing!
